### 1.0 Introduction

**1.1 Problem situation**


**1.2 What is the problem?**

**1.3 What does it matter?**

Nowadays, Airbnb has become an increasingly popular way for travelers to expand their travel possibilities and experience the city in a more unique way. In our research, the analysis of the data set can help us understand what are some of the most important factors that contribute to the distribution of Airbnb in New York City. And also to understand Which type of Airbnb do people prefer in current days.

**1.4 How it will be addressed?**

We will begin our research by analyzing the relationship between the locations and the number of Airbnbs using the data from the first data set. Then, we will analyze the possible correlation between the crime rate and the number of Airbnbs in the regions. It is very likely that we'll examine some more data that contribute to the distribution of Airbnbs in the later works. The analysis can be presented through data visualization. Since the data set may be affected by feedback loops and other factors, more information may be needed throughout the study.

### 2.0 Research questions

* What is the most popular type of Airbnb in New York City?

* Is there a trend between the number of crimes and the number of Airbnbs in that area?

* Are there any correlations between availability days and locations?


### 3.0 Possible data sets

**Data set 1: New York City Airbnb Data**

* _Web URL:_ https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data

_number of observations:_ 397

_number of attributes:_ 16

**Description:** The first data set includes information needed to analyze New York Airbnb, including area, location, owner, review count and price of Airbnbs in New York City. This is an up-to-date dataset that can be used to generate information about Airbnb in 2019.

**Date set 2: NYPD Complaint Data**

* _Web URL:_ https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Current-Year-To-Date-/5uac-w243

_number of observations:_ 347676

_number of attributes:_ 35

**Description:** This data set contains the complete records of crimes in New York City in 2019, including date, time, crime type, location, race, sex, etc. In this project, we'll mainly analyze the information of location in this data set and how the distribution of Airbnbs may attribute to the public safety in that region.



### 4.0 Information Visualization


### 5.0 Team Coordination
Weekly work time that every group member sit together is every Sunday at 10Am.

**Indivisual Goal**

**Klein Wang**

**Lexi Xia**

My goal is to learn to create an interactive visualization for exploring the data set with appropriate UI dialog controls. I want to learn how to cooperate better with teammates in the group project and get more familiar with Rstudio and Github.

**Lei Lei**

My personal goal is to better understand what factors might make Airbnb popular. I also want to learn how to effectively use the knowledge I learned in Information 201, especially on how to create effective data visualization. My role in this group is writer.  

**Shawn Song**

We will communicate weekly both in person and through group chat.


**Commitment on how you will give each other feedback on working together and
how you will address communication challenges or work breakdowns.**

We will give each other feedback on working together and address communication challenges or work breakdowns.
