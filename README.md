# Info-201A-Final-project

## Project Description:

Our goal for the New York City Airbnb project was to transform the New York City data set and turn it into visuals for future Airbnb owners and customers. Through our visualization, we hope to provide the customers and prospective Airbnb owners some information of the most popular Airbnb in the region, which could also provides some information about how the owners should operate their business in terms of selecting a specific location or selecting a price range, as well as how should customers select a Airbnb when plan their trips.  

## Expectations:

* Learn about the price range and room types of Airbnbs in New York City.

* Know where and which type of Airbnb is the most popular in New York.

* Considering the public safety factor, how does this relate to choosing an Airbnb location.

## Tools that we use:

In this project, we will mainly use tools like "Dplyr", "GGPlot2". "Dplyr" will be used to do data wrangling and selecting the data we want from the dataset. "GGplot" will be used to do Data visualizations such as creat graphs and maps.
